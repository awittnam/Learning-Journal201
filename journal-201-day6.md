Learning Journal Day 6

Monday (class 6) was a tough on.  We worked on object literals for the cookie stand.  We eventually got the JavaScript but it was a definite group effort and pair programming.  One thing I'd like to through out is that it would be nice if before the TA's leave for the night they either popped in for sent something is slack to let us know we were on our own.  But I also understand they need to be able to leave as well....popping in may be a double-edged sword.
PS. There's also not enough time in the day.
