Learning Journal Day 4  

Day 4 was a much needed lowkey assignment day.  After scratching and clawing to get caught it was nice to be able to collaborate with someone throughout the whole project.
It helped to be keying in front of someone who is also learning.  It shows you that it's ok to mess up in front of someone because 1. they're in the boat with you and 2. you get to debug it together and see how their learning process is.
