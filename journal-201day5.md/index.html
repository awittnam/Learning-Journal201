Learning Journal Day 5

This week was taxing.  I know it will be exponentially harder here in week two but the ramp up at the end of week one with the 5 code challenge questions was a nice touch.  I think the class is really starting to lien on each other when it comes to teaching each other concepts that one person really understands and someone else chiming in on another part.
