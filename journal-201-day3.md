Learning Journal Day 3

Day 3 was a rough one.  Playing catch up from the day before is for the birds.  But it has taught me or reinforced rather, NOT to sluff off on an assignment with the mentality of, "I'll just work on it this weekend."  No.  That won't work.  Fine tuning on the weekend if good, but HAVING to produce on the weekend is going to wear you down.  Especially with my commute, I need recovery time.
