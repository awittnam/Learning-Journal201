##  Learning Journal Day 15

By the end of the week things really felt like they came together mentally and code wise but physically I hit the wall.  I'm not making excuses, but the way I see it; most CF students in Seattle proper have a commute of 20-45 minutes.  On a good day for me, it's 1:45 in and and 1:15 home (3 hrs).  A bad traffic day can push is to 4.5-5 hrs.  Which physically, is like taking a road trip everyday.  I don't know about you, but driving that much everyday is physically taxing.  Mentally, I feel much better about the content than my grade shows.  In fact, my grade makes it look like I'm not very committed.  Which couldn't be farther from the truth.  Over the last three weeks we're made drastic changes to our life to accommodate the CF curriculum.  My sister-in-law took a work contract in Tacoma to help us watch our son.  And also trading in a vehicle on a better commuter vehicle.  This course is something I will pass.  And not, just barely pass.  I will be a highly competent DEV upon completion.
