Learning Journal Day 7

Tuesday, class 07 was a little bit of a break through.  I am starting to get more comfortable with "just trying stuff."  I started commenting out blocks of code and just playing with what I needed to accomplish (or attempt to accomplish) whatever task we were trying to tackle.  I know Wednesday will be challenging, but I feel like I'm in a better headspace to jump in.
